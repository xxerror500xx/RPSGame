# TOP_RPSGame

A simple Rock Paper Scissor console game. Built for The Odin Project - Web Development 101

- This application makes use of the [bootstrap Framework v4.0.0-beta.2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_(front-end_framework))
- This application makes use of some fun [Duck typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing) based off some code found [here](https://jsfiddle.net/311aLtkz/). It is not super robust or feature heavy but seems to have more reliability than using the User.agent method.

The most difficult part of this project was getting the logic for user input correct. Getting rid of multiple words / choosing correct weapon.
