A simple Rock Paper Scissor game. Built for The Odin Project - Web Development 101

- This application makes useage of some fun [Duck typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing) based off some code found [here](https://jsfiddle.net/311aLtkz/). It is not super robust or feature heavy but seems to have more reliability than using the User.agent method.
